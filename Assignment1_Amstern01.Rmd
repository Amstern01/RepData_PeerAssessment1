This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

##1. Loading and Preprocessing the data

```{r}
setwd("~/Performance Review/JHU Data Science/Assignments/Reproducible Research")
fileURL <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
download.file(fileURL, destfile = "./datazip.zip")
unzip("./datazip.zip", exdir = "./datazip")
data <- read.csv("./datazip/activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep= ",", fill = TRUE)
data$steps <- as.numeric(data$steps)
data$date <- as.Date(data$date)
data$interval <- as.numeric(data$interval)
```

##2. What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Calculate total number of steps per day

```{r}
StepsPerDay <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data, FUN = sum)
```

Plot histogram of total number of steps per day

```{r hist}
hist(StepsPerDay$steps)
```

Calculate mean and median values of total number of steps per day

```{r}
meanStep <- mean(StepsPerDay$steps)
medianStep <- median(StepsPerDay$steps)
meanStep <- as.numeric(meanStep)
medianStep <- as.numeric(medianStep)
```

The mean steps per day is `r meanStep` and the median steps per day is `r medianStep`.

##3. What is the average daily activity pattern?

Calculate the average number of steps per five minute interval

```{r}
ActivityPattern <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data, FUN = mean)
```

Plot the average number of steps per five minute interval
```{r}
plot(ActivityPattern$interval, ActivityPattern$steps, type = "l", main = "Average Number of Steps Per Five Minute Interval", xlab = "interval", ylab= "Average Steps")
```

Identify 5 minute interval with maximum average number of steps
```{r}
library(data.table)
DT <- as.data.table(ActivityPattern)
maxInt <- DT[,.SD[which.max(steps)]]
maxInt <- as.data.table(maxInt)
maxinterval <- maxInt$interval[1]
maxsteps <- maxInt$steps[1]
```
The interval with the highest average number of steps is interval `r maxinterval` at `r maxsteps` steps.


##4. Imputing missing values

Calculate number of rows with NAs
```{r}
missing <-data[rowSums(is.na(data)) > 0,]
missingrows <- nrow(missing)
```
      
The dataset has `r missingrows` rows with missing values

Imputing missing values based upon the average number of steps in the interval with the missing value.

```{r}
dataImpute <- data
setDT(dataImpute)[ActivityPattern, stepsi := i.steps, on='interval'][is.na(steps), steps := stepsi][,stepsi:= NULL][]
```

Calculate total number of steps per day for imputed dataset

```{r}
StepsPerDayImp <- aggregate(steps ~ date, dataImpute, FUN = sum)
```

Plot histogram of total number of steps per day for imputed dataset

```{r}
hist(StepsPerDayImp$steps)
```

Calculate mean and median values of total number of steps per day for imputed dataset

```{r}
meanImp <- mean(StepsPerDayImp$steps)
medianImp <- median(StepsPerDayImp$steps)

DiffMean <- meanStep - meanImp
DiffMedian <- medianStep - medianImp

```

The mean steps per day of the imputed data set is `r meanImp` and the median steps per day of the imputed dataset is `r medianImp`. The difference in means is `r DiffMean` and the difference in medians is `r DiffMedian` between the original and imputed datasets. Imputing the data does not change the mean number of steps per day but it does slightly alter the median number of steps per day.

##5. Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

Creating factor variable to indicate whether a given date is a weekday or weekend.

```{r}
data[ ,"Weekday"] <-NA
weekdaynames <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")

data$Weekday <- ifelse(weekdays(data$date) %in% weekdaynames, 1, 2)

data$Weekday <- factor(data$Weekday, levels = c(1,2), labels = c("Weekday", "Weekend"))

```

Plotting average number of steps per five minute interval faceted by weekday and weekend.

```{r}
weekData <- aggregate(steps ~ Weekday+interval, data=data, sum)
library(ggplot2)
wp <- ggplot(weekData, aes(x= interval, y= steps)) + geom_line() 
wp + facet_grid(Weekday ~ .)

```
